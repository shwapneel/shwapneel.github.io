      <p class="descriptionPara">	The Great Horned Owl's feathers and appearence have adapted to blend in with its surrounding environment. While its under parts are on the lighter side, it has dark brown markings on its wings to not give away its prescence during the night. It has the 2nd longest feet feathers of any owl. Its gunmetal grey beak and talons and reddish facial disk only add to its steath during its night time hunting.</p>

      <p class="nestingPara">	Despite being at the top of its food chain, young hatchlings of the Great Horned Owl are dependent on their parents for months after they initially hatch. It has also been found that the adult owls tend to have moved less than 80 kilometers from where they were born. The Great Horned Owl often starts to nest and lay eggs in late fall and have children who are fully feathered and capable of flight at about 8 weeks of age, however they will still stay with their parents until next fall.

      <h1 class="huntingHead"> "A Fierce Predator" </h1>
      <p class="huntingPara">	In addition, the Great Owl is a formidable hunter. Its body is perfectly attuned to hunting at night, being able to hunt rats, squirrels, marmots and even porcupines. The Great Horned Owl's Talons can produce 500 pounds of crushing force, while the average human can only make 60 pounds of force in their fist. Most deaths of these owls are attributed to human activities such as shooting and flying into traffic, despite this, the owl's abilities to survive and current numbers show that the species is not endangered by any means and is thought to be a species of least concern of going extinct.

      <p class="IconPara"> Many Tribes and Native American villages admire the Great Horned Owl for its proficiency in hunting. The Arikara would often hold rituals in which a mask made out of tail and wing feathers of the Great Horned Owl to honor the owl. The Pima believe that the Great Horned Owls are reincarnations of their fallen warriors. In addition. the Passamaquoddy believe the owl to be a type of friendly spirit.  </p>

      <h1 class="habitatHead"> "Always one nearby" </h1>
      <p class="habitatPara"> The habitat of the Great Horned Owl often lives in the forested regions of North America. It is known to make its home in all times of trees and often takes shelter in other places such as caves, stumps and even in the nests of other birds. Once mated, the Great Horned owl rarely leaves its home. It is currently the second most distributed owl species, right next to the barn owl.</p>

      <h1  class="longevityHead"> "A Long Lifespan" </h1>
      <p  class="longevityPara"> The Great Horned Owl is one of the least endangered birds there is in North America. It is not hunted as prey, however there have been some deaths attributed to hunting larger prey such as skunks and procupines. It should also be noted that many deaths for the Great Horned Owl are attributable to humans. Shootings, flying into traffic and large buildings, as well as intoxication ny pesticides are examples of ill effects of human activity to the species. Despite all this, the species is able to keep a healthy population size and is noted as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN).</p>
